Table 1
"Instructions: For each individual you signed up to collect, construct a biography of their life through the census and government employment history using the Official Register of Government Employment. For the Govt Employment information be sure to create a new entry each time the individual appears in the Official Registers. The current templates have six entries, but you may need more. Using Ancestry, the template contains a separate set of fields for each census year. Fill in information for each year.",,,,,,
